The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted deep, systemic inequities in healthcare access and
outcomes across racial and ethnic groups and geographic regions in the United States. This
report takes a deeper dive into two especially important questions to better understand these
disparities: were communities of color disproportionately affected by COVID-19 compared to
white populations, and did higher testing rates correlate with reduced adverse outcomes in these
communities? Using CDC data from the state of Nevada, we analyze state-level case rates,
testing and mortality trends to identify inequitable patterns in pandemic impacts. Our
investigation aims to bring to light meaningful insights about structural healthcare disparities
while also evaluating public health interventions.
